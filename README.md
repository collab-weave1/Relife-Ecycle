# ReLife â€“ Scalable Web Platform for E-Waste Management

Welcome to ReLife, a project focusing on Open Innovation, Sustainability, and CivicTech. It aims to revolutionize e-waste management through a comprehensive web platform designed for a circular economy.

## Problem statement: The E-Waste Challenge in India

India faces a monumental e-waste crisis. Only a small portion undergoes formal recycling. This results in significant environmental and health hazards. Furthermore, a lack of public awareness and fragmented data systems hinder brands from achieving their Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance targets.

## Proposed Solution: Relife

ReLife is a robust, web-based platform designed to bridge the critical gaps in e-waste management. It connects consumers, recyclers, informal workers, and producers, fostering a truly circular economy. It combines geo-based pickups, gamified eco-point rewards, educational modules, and compliance dashboards to drive sustainable, circular behavior across the e-waste lifecycle.
